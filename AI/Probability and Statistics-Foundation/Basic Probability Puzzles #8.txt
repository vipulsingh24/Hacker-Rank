'''
In a certain city, the probability of a resident not reading the morning newspaper is 1/2,
and the probability of a resident not reading the evening newspaper is 2/5. The probability they will read both newspapers is 1/5.

Find the probability that a resident reads a morning or evening newspaper.
'''

Probability of not reading morning newspaper (A’) = 1/2
Probability of reading morning newspaper (A) = 1 – 1/2 = 1/2 = P(A)
Probability of not reading evening newspaper (B’) = 2/5
Probability of reading evening news paper (B) = 1 – 2/5 = 3/5 = P(B)
P(A∩B) = 1/5
[ P(A∩B) = P(A).P(B), as A and B are independent.]

Probability of reading either of news papers = P(AUB)

= P(A) + P(B) – P(A∩B)

= 1/2 + 3/5 – 1/5

= 1/2 + 2/5 = 9/10.
